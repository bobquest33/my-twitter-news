# What is this? 
A python program that uses twitter's streaming API to create a 'news' summary for me. Right now, the program emails me periodically popular keywords of certain topics. This gives me a quick overview of topics that interest me.

I was tired of scrolling through my tweets to find something interesting, and also thought maybe I was missing out because I may not follow certain people. I also like to see what's popular in certain topics (for example, programming languages like javascript and java). 

# How it works 

- Install the required modules (pip) 
- Register an application with Twitter's dev console 
- Add configuration to your config.py file (config.py.sample in the repo) 
- Run python my_twitter_news.py 

Right now, all the keywords and counts are stored in local memory. In the future, I'd like to have it stored in a database.
